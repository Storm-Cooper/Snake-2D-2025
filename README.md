A basic recreation of the 1970s classic game "Snake". Designed to reignite old techniques and emphasize the wonder of simplicity.

This project is an interactive program that simulates an arcade-style game. It uses the arrow keys to move a character- which can gain elements and allow the player to attain a score. The project took a reasonable amount of time, but was not strenuous. It allowed for much research and new understanding, and the amount of trial and error was very humbling. The use many functions and subfunctions was not as tricky as I suspected, but the organization and the order of opertations for all of the individual functions was fairly heavy. Next time, I would prefer to work in a different order and not try and do all of the primary functions as a group- but write out the bulk and correct later. This was quite enjoyable and I am quite impressed if I do say so myself :)
