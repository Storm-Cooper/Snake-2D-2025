## Repository
"https://github.com/Storm-Cooper/Snake-2D-2025"

## Description
A basic recreation of the 1970s classic game "Snake". Designed to reignite old techniques and emphasize the wonder of simplicity.

## Features
- Feature 1
	- Utilizes Arrow Keys to move around in 2D space.
- Feature 2
	- "Apples" will appear to allow snake to grow longer.
- Feature N 
	- Game is over if snake crashes into itself or the walls.

## Challenges
- This will elicit a need to further study pygame and learn its many facets.
- The random concept will need to be constrained carefully.
- The clock/tick concept will need further studying as well.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The game perfectly reflects the original and functions in all the familiar ways.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The game looks similar to the original game with a functional interactive interface.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Acquire pygame knowledge
  2. Define functions

- Week 2
  1. Organize game facets
  2. Calculate all time-based actions within the program

- Week N (Final)
  1. Test over again, finalize colors and shapes
  2. Retest, submit
